^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/ats/core/fc-op*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that features can be identified and extracted from a Collection using query parameters.
^|Requirement |<<req_core_fc-op,/req/core/fc-op>>
^|Test Method |. For every feature collection identified in Collections, issue an HTTP GET request to the URL `/collections/{collectionId}/items` where `{collectionId}` is the encoded `id` property for a Collection described in the Collections content.
. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 200.
. Validate the contents of the returned document using test <<ats_core_fc-response,/ats/core/fc-response>>.

Repeat these tests using the following parameter tests:

*Bounding Box:*

* Parameter <<ats_core_fc-bbox-definition,/ats/core/fc-bbox-definition>>
* Response <<ats_core_fc-bbox-response,/ats/core/fc-bbox-response>>

*Limit:*

* Parameter <<ats_core_fc-limit-definition,/ats/core/fc-limit-definition>>
* Response <<ats_core_fc-limit-response,/ats/core/fc-limit-response>>

*DateTime:*

* Parameter <<ats_core_fc-time-definition,/ats/core/fc-time-definition>>
* Response <<ats_core_fc-time-response,/ats/core/fc-time-response>>

*Error conditions:*

* Query Invalid <<ats_core_query-param-invalid,/ats/core/query-param-invalid>>
* Query Unknown <<ats_core_query-param-unknown,/ats/core/query-param-unknown>>

Execute requests with combinations of the "bbox" and "datetime" query parameters
and verify that only features are returned that match both selection criteria.
